I&#039;ve been doing mostly simple web design with the obvious Wordpress integration blah blah blah. This client&#039;s project is what I would like to be doing, creating real web applications.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI was wondering if you have any tips for me on how to handle myself in the meeting. I&#039;m young, but outgoing and have no issue to talking to some one older than me, especially if I actually know about the subject I&#039;m talking about. I know you&#039;ve worked with clients big and small, cough Gourmet Live cough, and any advice you can give on communicating with some one that is about to entrust you with their final product would be great!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nps. Thanks so much for blogging as often as you do, its like a little surprise once a month...","answer":"<p>The best advice I can offer is to be succinct and honest. While it&#8217;s fine to bite off more than you can chew, you should only be accepting work you can actually do&#8212;i.e., it&#8217;s one thing to accept a project that is going to force you to work 70 hours a week (doable), it&#8217;s another to accept one that will force you to learn a new language\/technology in under two weeks (not doable). I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re doing the latter, but most young people who are trying to land their first large project tend to get themselves into a hole by promising stuff they can&#8217;t deliver on in hopes of locking in the job (I&#8217;ve done this before).<\/p>\n\n<p>Assuming you can handle the work, during the meeting you need to be clear about your strengths, why you&#8217;d be good for the project, and how you foresee doing the actual work. Don&#8217;t make a lot of excuses for why you haven&#8217;t done large projects in the past&#8212;everyone has to start somewhere.<\/p>\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t get the job, don&#8217;t be too deflated. There are plenty of other projects out there, and eventually, if you do good work, you&#8217;ll start getting them.<\/p>","tags":["work","advice"]},{"id":"2843101681","url":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2843101681","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2843101681\/questions-answers-please","type":"answer","date-gmt":"2011-01-20 16:23:40 GMT","date":"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 11:23:40","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1295540620,"format":"html","reblog-key":"LgABw64n","slug":"questions-answers-please","question":"Questions, answers, please!","answer":"<p><i>Twist my arm why don&#8217;t you?

First, from Anonymous and several of his friends:<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Like any Apple Fanboy, you seem to buy every new product the company announces. At this point, what are all the Apple products you own at the moment?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>Oh, sure, I&#8217;d love to answer an insulting question from someone who uses the term &#8220;fanboy&#8221;. In fact, I can answer it very easily: I own nearly every consumer product Apple makes. And, I bought them without thinking. I just buy anything they make because I&#8217;m a pinhead and I can&#8217;t make up my own mind. If only I loved Linux or Microsoft or Dell as much as I love Apple! Then I wouldn&#8217;t be a fanboy and I could fill my house with carefully selected, cheap, plastic products that are user-unfriendly and break easily. Life would be so much better!<\/p>\n\n<p><b>If I move to New York will you hang out with me?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s nice of you to ask, and I&#8217;d love to say yes, but you <i>just<\/i> <a href=\"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2817916612\/ive-got-your-big-decision-right-here-pal\">missed me<\/a>. Sorry! Perhaps in 2016?<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Your girlfriend is very cute. Is she puerto-rican? Do you mind me asking is she a lot younger than you?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>Thanks, I agree, she is very cute. But she&#8217;s not Puerto Rican and she&#8217;s not younger than me. In fact, she&#8217;s older than me. I call her my &#8220;old lady&#8221; and I say things like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re old.&#8221; Sometimes I kick her cane out from under her or push the button on her medic-alert bracelet to call the paramedics just to josh her. She doesn&#8217;t think this is funny. But, since she&#8217;s not Puerto Rican, at least I don&#8217;t have to worry about her complaining constantly about the confusing state of their commonwealth political status.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Your girlfriend is hot sauce poured over sexy burrito. How&#8217;d you do it?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>I agree with the sentiment, although I don&#8217;t know that I would have chosen those words. How&#8217;d I do it? I&#8217;m not sure. I guess I spent a while looking put together, acted somewhat intelligent, made some jokes, and finally got a chance to use that mind control powder I bought in 2005. It worked really well. The only side effect is that it&#8217;s slowly turning her into a Puerto Rican.<\/p>\n\n<p><i>And now, some less anonymous folks:<\/i><\/p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/evanwalsh.net\/\">evanwalsh<\/a>: Are you going to buy the new Decemberists album?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p>Going to, am and did.

Or at least major for me.<\/p>\n\n<p>In July of this year, we&#8217;re moving to Los Angeles. That&#8217;s the short version, here&#8217;s the slightly longer version:<\/p>\n\n<p>These past few years I have grown as a developer, a designer, and more recently as a business owner and entrepreneur. I&#8217;ve spent the last 11 years busting my ass working for various companies, building various products, and then starting two businesses of my own, including my current company, <a href=\"http:\/\/gokarbon.com\" title=\"Karbon\">Karbon<\/a>. Things have gone very well and I&#8217;m proud to be able to say that. But, at the same time, this business, this work, isn&#8217;t my only interest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since childhood I&#8217;ve been enamored with television and film. My earliest memories are of making home movies, performing comedy sketches with cousins and friends, and watching hours and hours of TV. My fascination continued through high school, where I wrote a television pilot and several short films, and into college where I studied electronic filmmaking and acted in as many projects as I could find. After college, though, reality set in and I needed to make money. Luckily, endless interest in computers, the internet and technology allowed me to turn my hobby of web development into a full-time job and, eventually, to running my own company today. But during the past 11 years I&#8217;ve constantly wished I could focus more time and energy on film and really try to make a career out of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very fortunate to run the kind of business that doesn&#8217;t require an office or a specific locale. My clients are all over the globe, and it doesn&#8217;t matter where our computers are so long as there&#8217;s a reliable internet connection. So, in July, Karbon is officially moving to Los Angeles. We&#8217;ll continue to do the same kind of awesome work we&#8217;re doing now, just from a different area code. But the huge benefit will be that we can also spend time trying to make our other dreams come true, by focusing our free time on television and film work.<\/p>\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll note I keep saying &#8220;we&#8221; which actually has two separate meanings. The first is that <a href=\"http:\/\/morrisonfilm.com\" title=\"MorrisonFilm\">Shawn Morrison<\/a>, who works for Karbon and whom I&#8217;ve been making films and comedy with for years, is also moving to Los Angeles. This decision to move would have been so much harder had it not been for Shawn and his wife also taking the plunge. We&#8217;ll continue to work together both at Karbon and on new film projects as we attempt to navigate the Hollywood experience. The other &#8220;we&#8221; is that I&#8217;ve somehow convinced my girlfriend Stacey I&#8217;m worth the gamble, and she&#8217;s coming with me to LA as well. She has a real, serious, respectful career and so I cannot wait to hopefully become successful in a vapid profession to even the universe back out.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, the process has already begun. This past weekend, I packed up the apartment in which I had lived for eight years&#8212;the longest I have ever lived anywhere in my entire life&#8212;and moved to New Jersey into Stacey&#8217;s apartment. Her spacious place will serve us well as a temporary home until we pack everything up and ship it all to the west coast in six months.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love New York, and I cannot imagine not living in the city again at some point, but for now the time has come to be adventurous and try what I&#8217;ve never had the guts to try before. After all, time&#8217;s a wasting.<\/p>","tags":["me","life","karbon","la"]},{"id":"2749643340","url":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2749643340","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2749643340\/why-have-i-been-keeping-these-old-boxes-view-at","type":"photo","date-gmt":"2011-01-14 22:18:33 GMT","date":"Fri, 14 Jan 2011 17:18:33","bookmarklet":1,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1295043513,"format":"html","reblog-key":"iOOIkf7E","slug":"why-have-i-been-keeping-these-old-boxes-view-at","photo-caption":"<p><b>Why have I been keeping these old boxes?<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/garrettmurray\/5355059871\/\">View at Flickr<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Some of them are as old as 8 years.

Instagram makes it easy to share your photos (and make them look even better) with friends and strangers, as well as find new friends to follow. Simple like and comment functionality adds just the right amount of social interaction. I spend way too much time every day thinking about photos to take for Instagram, and just as many browsing friends&#8217; photostreams. If you have an iPhone and you aren&#8217;t using Instagram, you&#8217;re a damned fool. (You can find me in Instagram with the username <b>garrettmurray<\/b>.)<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Favorite Photography Apps<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/artandmobile.com\/tiltshift\/\" title=\"TiltShiftGen\">TiltShiftGen<\/a> <i>(99\u00a2, free demo)<\/i><br\/>\nI rarely use TiltShiftGen the way it was intended (to create the tilt-shift effect)&#8212;instead, I use it to give a nice depth to photos taken with the iPhone that otherwise look very flat. TSG&#8217;s simple blur functionality (radial or linear) allows for changing both the strength of the blur as well as the distance, and it&#8217;s dead-simple to use. Granted, you have to be careful not to go overboard, but TSG is invaluable for classing up normal, flat iPhone photos.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/campl.us\/\" title=\"Camera+\">Camera+<\/a> <i>(99\u00a2)<\/i><br\/>Recently re-released to the App Store after many months away for breaking App Store rules, Camera+ returned with a new UI (which is much better than version 1&#8217;s) and new features. Camera+ is perfect for taking photos in less-than-ideal light situations because of its two-finger &#8220;touch exposure and focus&#8221; functionality, which allows you to use one finger to set focus and a second finger to choose where the camera should meter for light. This allows you to take more balanced photos than the native Camera app. In addition, Camera+ features lots of nice built-in filter and editing tools, as well as a new in-app-purchasable set of filters called &#8220;I &lt;3 Analog&#8221; which includes some really great settings.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Favorite Apps I Use Daily<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/reederapp.com\/2\/\" title=\"Reeder\">Reeder<\/a> <i>($2.99)<\/i><br\/>There isn&#8217;t much to say about Reeder, which is a testament to how good it is. It&#8217;s pretty much the perfect newsreader. The iOS app is sharp, simple and feature-rich without being in your face about it. (And the new in-beta OS X app is pretty great too.)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/gowalla.com\/iphone\" title=\"Gowalla\">Gowalla<\/a> <i>(Free)<\/i><br\/>By now, nearly everyone either uses Gowalla or knows what it is. These days, I use it mostly as a way to track where I&#8217;ve been and less as a social game as it was once intended. I enjoy collecting items and pins, but more so I enjoy being able to see a list of everywhere I&#8217;ve been in the past few years. As a data junky, this kind of thing is fun to have. And Gowalla&#8217;s recent redesign is gorgeous.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sophiestication.com\/articles\/\" title=\"Articles\">Articles<\/a> <i>($2.99)<\/i><br\/>Wikipedia presented beautifully with searching, tabs and more. I use Articles at least a few times a day to settle arguments, read about various historical events, and get behind-the-scenes information about the production of various movies I&#8217;ve recently seen.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Favorite New App of 2010<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/edovia.com\/screens\" title=\"Screens\">Screens<\/a> <i>($14.99)<\/i><br\/>It&#8217;s crazy to say this, but Screens is a fully-functional, beautiful VNC app for iOS that actually works and works well. That I can control my computer from my iPhone is old news (apps like TouchPad and its competitors have been doing this for quite some time), but that I can actually see my screen and use my computer from across the room, on a 3.5-inch screen, without being frustrated, is amazing.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Favorite Games<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicgames.com\/infinityblade\/\" title=\"Infinity Blade\">Infinity Blade<\/a> <i>($5.99)<\/i><br\/>If you had shown me Infinity Blade even 5 years ago and told me it was running on a phone I would have punched you in the face and stolen your phone. Infinity Blade is an amazing technical achievement, with sharp, highly detailed graphics, great sound, and a smooth framerate. It also happens to be a fun game with a simple but solid leveling-up mechanic, inventory system and other RPG elements. The story is dead-simple (basically one line of script), but the battles are fun and I kept playing even after I beat it just to keep leveling up my character. Infinity Blade is not only a great game, but it truly feels like the beginning of some amazing things that will happen in the iOS gamespace in the next few months and years.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ponos.co.jp\/iphone\/en\/mraahh.htm\" title=\"Mr. AahH!!\">Mr. AahH!!<\/a> <i>(99\u00a2)<\/i><br\/>Let&#8217;s ignore the title of this game for a moment, because it&#8217;s ridiculous. Putting that aside, Mr. AahH!! is a terrific play-when-you-have-a-spare-moment game. It&#8217;s addictive, simple, challenging and fun. Watch a little character swing from platform to platform and touch the screen when he should let go of the rope. Land him on platforms and try to get him as close to the middle as you can. Added challenges when wind and different levels of gravity are involved. Stupid-simple fun.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hemispheregames.com\/osmos-iphone\/\" title=\"Osmos\">Osmos<\/a> <i>(99\u00a2)<\/i><br\/>A beautiful game with a terrific atmospheric soundtrack. Osmos involves all sorts of challenges and includes a large number of levels with varying degrees of difficulty, as well as an unlockable arcade mode. There were levels I played that took me 40+ tries, but I never got frustrated&#8212;I just kept trying different strategies. A remarkably soothing gameplay experience, considering how complex some of the levels can be.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/godzilab-games.com\/?page_id=289\" title=\"StarDunk\">StarDunk<\/a> <i>(Free)<\/i><br\/>In a nutshell, StarDunk is a massively multiplayer online basket shooting game. There are a few additions (different ball types with different features, various in-game bonuses like shooting three balls at once for a time), but at its core, this is that carnival game of shooting as many baskets as you can in a set time, only with hundreds of other people playing at the same time. It&#8217;s addictive, simple, and fun. (You can play offline as well, if you don&#8217;t have an internet connection.)<\/p>","tags":["nerdery","ios","iphone","favorites","list"]},{"id":"2514919890","url":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2514919890","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2514919890\/firefox-me-view-bigger-on-flickr-we-were","type":"photo","date-gmt":"2010-12-29 18:40:38 GMT","date":"Wed, 29 Dec 2010 13:40:38","bookmarklet":1,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1293648038,"format":"html","reblog-key":"AK1VLsC5","slug":"firefox-me-view-bigger-on-flickr-we-were","photo-caption":"<p><b>Firefox, Me<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/garrettmurray\/5298950431\/lightbox\/\">View bigger on Flickr<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>We were snowed in on Monday, and we ended up spending the day in bed.

I hope so.","answer":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2391445359\/addressing-karbon-holiday-cards-view-bigger-at\">That is me<\/a>, and I am indeed left-handed. While current statistics show only 8-15% of the population is left-handed, I have to admit we&#8217;ve got some pretty awesome folks on our side. Aside from the obvious ones (current US President Obama is a lefty), did you know that Dan Aykroyd, Robert DeNiro, Jerry Seinfeld and Bruce Willis were left-handed? Not only that, but apparently Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar were also lefties.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being left-handed is like being in a club. I don&#8217;t know a lot of left-handed people, and I always remember people I&#8217;ve met who are. And still, to this day, whenever I sign something in front of a stranger or friend for the first time, they say, &#8220;Hey! You&#8217;re left-handed!&#8221; and then tell me people a cousin or brother or friend they have who is also a southpaw.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are drawbacks. When I was in school and they started teaching us to use computers, they forced me to the use the mouse with my right hand (I eventually switched to my left years later), and I learned out to switch hit in baseball because the gym teacher refused to let me hit lefty in school, but I hit lefty at home. To this day, I can only throw a frisbee with my right hand for some reason. And, a lot of us write with our arms at an awful, curled angle because otherwise we smear the ink across the page.<\/p>","tags":["me","lefties"]},{"id":"2391445359","url":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2391445359","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/log.maniacalrage.net\/post\/2391445359\/addressing-karbon-holiday-cards-view-bigger-at","type":"photo","date-gmt":"2010-12-20 20:07:00 GMT","date":"Mon, 20 Dec 2010 15:07:00","bookmarklet":1,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1292875620,"format":"html","reblog-key":"4OsYK0ol","slug":"addressing-karbon-holiday-cards-view-bigger-at","photo-caption":"<p><b>Addressing Karbon Holiday Cards<\/b> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/garrettmurray\/5274912994\/in\/photostream\/lightbox\/\">View bigger at Flickr<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>Thanking clients for a great 2010.
