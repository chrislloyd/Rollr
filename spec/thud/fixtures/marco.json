The original was extremely slow and limited, but the new generation is much faster and more versatile. Most importantly, the 13&#8221; Air now has the screen resolution of the previous-generation 15&#8221; MacBook Pro. These improvements made the 13&#8221; good enough for a lot of former 15&#8221; buyers &#8212; and many former 13&#8221; buyers are now in love with the new 11&#8221; Air for maximum portability.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last week, rumors started circulating that existing stock of 13&#8221; and 15&#8221; MacBook Pros was dwindling, which usually indicates an imminent update. So what should we expect?<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t foresee major changes to the 17&#8221; MacBook Pro. It&#8217;s an aircraft carrier made for maximum performance, maximum capacity, and rarely-used hardware features (like the ExpressCard slot) to sell to people who actually need them, such as people operating portable recording setups. When Apple wants to remove features from the rest of the lineup, they can usually appease most of the &#8220;We&#8217;re still using that!&#8221; crowd by keeping it in the 17&#8221; for a few more generations.<\/p>\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where I think Apple&#8217;s going to shove the optical drive: the 17&#8221;, and the $999 plastic MacBook. That&#8217;s it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the removal of optical drives and the awesomeness and low price of the 13&#8221; Air will leave little reason to buy the 13&#8221; MacBook Pro, so I&#8217;m guessing it will be eliminated from the lineup.<\/p>\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m guessing that the 15&#8221; will undergo its most significant change in a very long time: it will adopt the wedge shape of the Air, losing its thick, uncomfortably sharp front edge. Removing the optical drive will free up a lot of space inside, leaving room for a rearrangement that can enable the wedge shape without giving up a significant amount of battery volume.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ideally, this would come with two other major changes:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>No more glass screen.<\/strong> Glass is much heavier, shows <em>far<\/em> more glare, and requires a thicker screen lid than the &#8220;glossy&#8221; plastic screens on the Airs and plastic MacBooks. To make the 15&#8221; significantly lighter and thinner, Apple needs to drop the glass. (This isn&#8217;t a very strong prediction as much as it&#8217;s wishful thinking.)<\/li>\n<li><p><strong>SSDs only.<\/strong> This is much trickier in the 15&#8221; lineup, but the wedge shape could start out a lot thinner if it didn&#8217;t need to accommodate a 2.5&#8221; drive bay for a traditional hard drive. This, I think, is the riskiest prediction here: it&#8217;d be a ballsy move for Apple&#8217;s only hard-drive-bearing laptops to be the plastic 13&#8221; and the massive 17&#8221;. A lot of 13&#8221; and 15&#8221; MacBook Pro buyers want a lot more disk space than current SSDs offer at reasonable prices. But the benefits in performance, reliability, and case-design freedom would be huge, and that&#8217;s exactly the kind of ballsy hardware move that Apple likes to make.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another possibility would be to offer a dual-drive solution, similar to the new iMacs: include a permanent mSATA SSD <em>and<\/em> a 2.5&#8221; bay for a second hard drive for extra media storage or Time Machine. But that&#8217;s an inelegant workaround to the temporary economic and capacity shortcomings of SSDs, requiring a lot of space in the case, user-facing complexity<sup id=\"fnref:p3027446896-1\"><a href=\"#fn:p3027446896-1\" rel=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup>, and reduced battery life. That&#8217;s the kind of half-assed hardware compromise that Apple <em>doesn&#8217;t<\/em> usually make.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>I&#8217;m predicting the next 15&#8221; to be, effectively, the halfway point between the current one and what you&#8217;d expect a 15&#8221; Air to be.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have little doubt that this is the future of the 15&#8221;, but I do think it&#8217;s risky to predict it <em>now<\/em>. Apple always kills off old technology and moves forward a little too soon for some people&#8217;s comfort (which usually works out very well), but this is a major change, and it might be too much at once.<\/p>\n\n<p>I see two major problems with this direction, if it&#8217;s taken: the hard-drive-or-SSD question from above, and what to do about the big ports. It would be very difficult to fit Ethernet and Firewire ports into the sides of a wedge-shaped case. Apple could conceivably ditch both for the 15&#8221; and keep them in the 17&#8221;, but that&#8217;s also a very ballsy move that would anger a lot of pro buyers. I don&#8217;t think Apple would make proprietary tiny ports with dongles for Ethernet or Firewire, and neither can be operated well through USB<sup id=\"fnref:p3027446896-2\"><a href=\"#fn:p3027446896-2\" rel=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup>, so to adopt the wedge, they&#8217;d probably need to drop both.<\/p>\n\n<p>The wedge requires a lot of tradeoffs to get thinness, a more comfortable front edge, and a likely-significant weight reduction.<sup id=\"fnref:p3027446896-3\"><a href=\"#fn:p3027446896-3\" rel=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup> The result would be an incredibly compelling laptop for most buyers wanting more screen space and performance than the 13&#8221; Air, but its omissions would push a lot of power users to the 17&#8221; to get the ports and capacities that they need (which they wouldn&#8217;t appreciate at all).<\/p>\n\n<p>Or they could keep approximately the same shape, thickness, and weight of the current 15&#8221;. But then there&#8217;s so much free space inside that they could easily keep the optical drive and 2.5&#8221; hard-drive bay as well, so they might as well just keep the exact same design and just update the boring core components unceremoniously. And this might be a good enough stopgap to kill some time until most people stop needing wired Ethernet and Firewire, and SSDs are big and cheap enough to give most people enough space at reasonable prices. I&#8217;d argue that those have already happened, but just <em>barely<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So the new laptop lineup might look like this:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>$999 plastic MacBook, unchanged, for econobuyers<\/li>\n<li>$999&#160;11&#8221; MacBook Air<\/li>\n<li>$1299&#160;13&#8221; MacBook Air<\/li>\n<li>$1599&#160;15&#8221; MacBook Pro, new wedge design (down from $1799)<\/li>\n<li>$2299&#160;17&#8221; MacBook Pro, unchanged<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Or it might look almost exactly like the current lineup<sup id=\"fnref:p3027446896-4\"><a href=\"#fn:p3027446896-4\" rel=\"footnote\">4<\/a><\/sup>, which would be disappointing but justifiable.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn:p3027446896-1\">\n<p>&#8220;Where are my files?

They generally hear about individual phones, without distinguishing much based on operating system. (They don&#8217;t know what those are, either.)<\/p>\n\n<p>The highest-profile Android launch that seemed to meaningfully reach the masses was the Motorola Droid, primarily because it was boosted by a massive Verizon television and in-store ad campaign.<\/p>\n\n<p>But since then, very few non-geeks know about individual Android handsets. They change so frequently, and are so numerous, that there&#8217;s never much of an opportunity for a meaningful buzz to generate around any of them. Nobody&#8217;s lining up to buy them. CNN&#8217;s not covering their launches. Consumer Reports isn&#8217;t vigorously testing their antennas. The Daily Show isn&#8217;t making jokes about them. So the mass market doesn&#8217;t really respond to individual devices. Even if Uncle Joe brings his fancy Android Something to Thanksgiving and your mother is impressed by it and wants to buy one, by the time her contract expires in two months and she goes to the Verizon store, it&#8217;s gone.<\/p>\n\n<p>The incessant glut of Android phones creates other problems in practice, too:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Accessory markets never fully develop. People <em>really<\/em> like cases for their phones, and if the iPhone has 300 cases for it including that gummy pink one they really like, and the Samsung Whocares XL only has a few drab OEM plastic things available, a nontrivial portion of the market will choose the iPhone on that reason alone.<\/p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also more practical concerns: batteries, docks, speakers, and other useful accessories are usually phone-specific, and if the manufacturer (and the market) will only care about your phone for three months until the next minor revision comes out, your options will be very limited, both in the store and when you&#8217;re traveling and forgot something.<\/p><\/li>\n<li>There are so many variations in screen size, screen type, physical size, hardware sensors, hardware buttons, and computational performance between devices that developers, including Google itself, have a very hard time making great software for the platform.<\/li>\n<li>The manufacturers and carriers have very little incentive to maintain the software on devices that are still relatively new and under contract, because they want everyone buying the newest ones instead. We&#8217;re already seeing carriers and some manufacturers refusing to release new Android versions to handsets that were launched as recently as 6 months ago, even though most users bought them with 2-year contracts.<\/li>\n<li>People hate choosing between similar things. The more choice we have at the time of purchase, the more stress we feel making the choice, and the less satisfied we feel afterward because we&#8217;re worried that we made the wrong choice.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The entire Android device market seems to be made specifically <em>for<\/em> gadget blogs and early adopters.<\/p>\n\n<p>But for the mass market, the constant flood of Android devices is indeed a problem.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Not just Android<\/h4>\n\n<p>This effect isn&#8217;t limited to Android. One of the main reasons why Windows Phone 7 had a relatively underwhelming launch is that there was no single &#8220;Windows phone&#8221; to gather buzz, press, extensive reviews, and customer affinity.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, we were greeted with a bevy of hardware choices that we neither asked for nor wanted. Rather than committing to one device &#8212; taking a stand and saying, &#8220;This is what we think is best, and we&#8217;ll support it for the next two years&#8221; &#8212; Microsoft punted, leaving the manufacturers to give us too many fragmented choices that will likely face many of the same issues we see in the Android market.<\/p>\n\n<p>And the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2546655554\">tablet market<\/a>&#8221; will face the same issue.<\/p>","tags":["_readlater","bestof"]},{"id":"2709841284","url":"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2709841284","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2709841284","type":"link","date-gmt":"2011-01-12 06:12:00 GMT","date":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 01:12:00","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1294812720,"format":"markdown","reblog-key":"VhEPvHHd","slug":"watts-martin-whos-afraid-of-the-verizon-iphone","link-text":"Watts Martin: Who's Afraid of the Verizon iPhone?","link-url":"http:\/\/chipotle.tumblr.com\/post\/2700891266\/whos-afraid-of-the-verizon-iphone","link-description":"<p>I was going to write about this angle of the Verizon iPhone, but Watts Martin already did a better job of communicating what I wanted to say, plus more, in this post:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But in the US market the great Google vs. Apple Fight Fight Fight! has been a lot less of a real competition than either the technology press or the cheering fans make it out to be. With Verizon getting the iPhone and AT&amp;T getting Android-powered phones that don\u2019t suck, though, consumers who aren\u2019t nerds are going to be finally making side-by-side comparisons when they walk into their neighborhood cell phone store.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, Android has moved a lot of volume. But the platform&#8217;s various devices seem to lack most of the passionate customer demand that iPhones have always had. Nobody&#8217;s lining up the night before to buy them. Even the gadget blogs have a hard time feigning enthusiasm for this week&#8217;s hot Android phone because they still haven&#8217;t taken the shrinkwrap off of last week&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whenever I&#8217;ve overheard conversations about smartphones in real life, by &#8220;normal people&#8221; (not geeks like us), it has always been clear that the true battle happening in the U.S. phone market wasn&#8217;t iPhone versus Android, but iPhone versus Verizon.<\/p>\n\n<p>The decision that people were discussing wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Do I get an iPhone or an Android whatever?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p>It was always &#8220;Do I get an iPhone or do I stay on Verizon?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p>I get the feeling that very few people except anti-Apple geeks really care about Android itself. The buying decision for most seemed to be, &#8220;I&#8217;m on Verizon and don&#8217;t want to switch, so which of the phones in the Verizon store looks best? They say this one is just as good as an iPhone. I guess I&#8217;ll get that.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p>Granted, this is purely anecdotal and speculative. And <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.marco.org\/207\">my speculation is wrong a lot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I suspect that the media&#8217;s conversation about Android versus iPhone is going to be very different in a year. Even moreso in two years, the duration of the average Verizon contract. And it&#8217;s not looking great for Android.<\/p>\n\n<p>The iPhone is going to gain a lot of U.S. marketshare by being on Verizon, and it&#8217;s going to come significantly at Android&#8217;s expense. (BlackBerry will lose some of their Verizon customers to iPhone, too, but I bet Android will lose proportionally much more.)<\/p>\n\n<p>One effect I expect to start immediately: developers of popular iPhone apps are going to feel a lot less pressure to write Android versions if it becomes apparent, or if we all just speculate in the same way, that Android isn&#8217;t in fact going to take any more U.S. marketshare away from Apple and is likely to give back some of what they took over the last year. Android&#8217;s marketshare may have just peaked.<\/p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying Android is going to be &#8220;killed&#8221;, or that it will be reduced to a miniscule installed base. Neither are remotely likely.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I think over the next few quarters, it&#8217;s going to become far less relevant.<\/p>"},{"id":"2709287387","url":"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2709287387","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2709287387","type":"link","date-gmt":"2011-01-12 05:24:57 GMT","date":"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 00:24:57","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1294809897,"format":"markdown","reblog-key":"MZEqCmAA","slug":"marco-org-everyone-else-is-arguing-about-html-5s","link-text":"Marco.org: Everyone else is arguing about HTML 5's video codecs.

It&#8217;s impossible to do any meaningful product research with Google.<\/p>\n\n<p>But recently, spam has taken over the &#8220;guide&#8221; query results, and even many &#8220;reference&#8221; queries. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if spam even started defeating the &#8220;address bar&#8221; queries &#8212; Google&#8217;s ranking algorithms recently have had a lot of trouble detecting the canonical source of duplicated content.<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s now nearly impossible to find good results for many commonly asked types of queries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Part of what exacerbates this is the apparent explosion recently of cheap-&#8220;content&#8221; sites that try to answer every search query ever asked. Like affiliate-marketing spam, much of it seems to be generated by humans (technically &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t classify them as such), but it&#8217;s functionally useless: sites like About.com, eHow, and countless clones with .info domain names that promise to address every niche question and informational topic, but whose content lacks all quality and substance.<\/p>\n\n<p>Google was designed to play the role of a passive observer of the internet: web content was created for people, not specific Google queries, and Google would look around, take inventory of what was available, and give it to people who asked. Google&#8217;s general, big-picture algorithms probably haven&#8217;t changed much since the days when this was relatively accurate.<\/p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s no longer what web content looks like. Now, massive amounts of technically-not-spam sites are generated by penny-hungry affiliate marketers and sleazy web &#8220;content&#8221; startups to target long-tail Google queries en masse, scraping content from others or paying low-wage workers to churn out formulaic, minimally nutritious pages to answer them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Searching Google is now like asking a question in a crowded flea market of hungry, desperate, sleazy salesmen who all claim to have the answer to every question you ask.<\/p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Hey, anyone know how to wire an outlet?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Did you say &#8216;how to wire an outlet&#8217;?&#8221;<br\/>\n&#8220;I can help you with how to wire an outlet!&#8221;<br\/>\n&#8220;Here is info on how to wire an outlet!&#8221;<br\/>\n&#8220;Bargain prices on how to wire an outlet!&#8221;<br\/>\n&#8220;Guide to wiring outlets in New York, right here!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n<p>And none of them actually know a damn thing about what you&#8217;re asking, of course &#8212; they&#8217;re just offering meaningless, valueless words that seem to form sentences until you actually try to make use of them.<\/p>\n\n<p>They call this &#8220;content&#8221;. But it&#8217;s not, really &#8212; it&#8217;s filler. And by a more common-sense definition, it&#8217;s spam. But Google either doesn&#8217;t think so, or is so overwhelmed by its volume that it has seemingly stopped trying to keep it under control. (I&#8217;m betting on the former.)<\/p>\n\n<p>One solution may be for Google to radically change their algorithms and policies for web search to de-emphasize phrase-matching and more strongly prioritize inbound links and credibility. And, in what&#8217;s probably a huge departure for them, have <em>human<\/em> employees use their <em>opinions<\/em> of site quality to manually adjust the relevance of domains.<\/p>\n\n<p>But I doubt we&#8217;ll see real progress. Instead, I expect Google&#8217;s unwillingness to address this issue to create a critical-mass demand &#8212; and hopefully, then, a supply &#8212; of <em>good<\/em> content, reference information, and product recommendations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Much of this will be (or currently is) solved the old-fashioned way: personal recommendations and trusted authorities. But these can&#8217;t cover the breadth of available information that web searchers need.
