I wanted to run through a few of the things our engineers have been working on behind the scenes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our #1 priority has been bringing your blogs back to 100% uptime. We project the graph below on our wall, showing us exactly how many error messages we are serving instead of real pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lfr9jsB4ss1qz4rgq.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live and die by this chart, and we\u2019ve been pulling nights and weekends working to remove the bottlenecks that have made \u201cover capacity\u201d errors routine. The list of systems we\u2019ve tackled includes everything from networking equipment to database queries to the deep dark insides of the Linux kernel. (If working on these kinds of challenge gets your pulse up, we want to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/jobs\">hear from you<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we break through our past bottlenecks, we are simultaneously faced with growth like we\u2019ve never seen before. Our challenge is not only to support the current audience of 55 million, but to get <em>ahead<\/em> of more than 250,000,000 new pageviews <strong>each week<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, we\u2019ve made incredible progress in improving our infrastructure. We\u2019re not out of the woods yet, but we expect these coming weeks to be <strong>much<\/strong> smoother than the past few rocky months. We\u2019re incredibly confident in our ability to scale to serve all of the visitors to your awesome blogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple specific issues I want to cover:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>The Queue feature<\/strong>\u00a0has been disabled more often than not over the last two weeks. We hit an incredibly difficult problem with the way the Queue processes handle their <em>publishing<\/em>\u00a0step that forced us to unwind and rewrite a big chunk of our publishing routine. The Queues have been completely restored for the last couple days and we don\u2019t foresee any more issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>This morning<\/strong>\u00a0we suffered an outage for nearly an hour starting at about 7am EST. The proxy server that handles the vast majority of incoming requests failed, and its automatic backup also failed because of an unrelated networking issue. It took us longer than hoped to correct the multiple causes, but we\u2019ve put systems into place to make sure that even another double failure won\u2019t cause an outage like this in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever run into issues, please don\u2019t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:support@tumblr.com\">contact support<\/a>. And you can check known issues via our <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tumblr\">Twitter feed<\/a>\u00a0or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/help\">Help<\/a> page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your patience and support through all of this. To make up for it, we have some absolutely epic product updates around the corner.<\/p>"},{"id":"2983280388","url":"http:\/\/staff.tumblr.com\/post\/2983280388","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/staff.tumblr.com\/post\/2983280388\/piers-morgan","type":"photo","date-gmt":"2011-01-28

Then something happened. One weekend, he was visiting family in Huntington Beach, and he stopped by an old studio he used to hang around &#8212; the Distillery. Nick knew it was now or never, so he used the money from a pawned amp to pay for studio time and called everyone who played music in the area, and Pres Record Co. was born. Their first release was never processed by a computer and mastered from tape to lacquer, the labels hand letterpressed, the pressing done manually &#8212; not a single creative corner cut.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Also check out\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/kristophergrunert.tumblr.com\/\" title=\"KRISTOPHER GRUNERT\">Kristopher Grunert<\/a><\/strong><br\/>\nUses lines, movement, and light to create architectural, industrial, and landscape photographs.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/exhibita.tumblr.com\/\" title=\"exhibit-A-mixed bag\">Exhibit-A-Mixed Bag<\/a><\/strong><br\/>\nCurating items of personal interest.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/kylewritescode.com\/\" title=\"Kyle Bragger\">Kyle Bragger<\/a><\/strong><br\/>\nKyle codes cool things.<\/p>","photo-link-url":"http:\/\/presco.tumblr.com\/","width":"500","height":"237","photo-url-1280":"http:\/\/24.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_500.png","photo-url-500":"http:\/\/24.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_500.png","photo-url-400":"http:\/\/25.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_400.png","photo-url-250":"http:\/\/28.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_250.png","photo-url-100":"http:\/\/28.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_100.png","photo-url-75":"http:\/\/29.media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_lei843bhDw1qz8q0ho1_75sq.png","photos":[],"tags":["Tumblr Tuesday"]},{"id":"2500384175","url":"http:\/\/staff.tumblr.com\/post\/2500384175","url-with-slug":"http:\/\/staff.tumblr.com\/post\/2500384175\/name-julie-arnold-location-johnson-city-tennessee","type":"photo","date-gmt":"2010-12-28 18:54:52 GMT","date":"Tue, 28 Dec 2010 13:54:52","bookmarklet":0,"mobile":0,"feed-item":"","from-feed-id":0,"unix-timestamp":1293562492,"format":"markdown","reblog-key":"D3d7SGfw","slug":"name-julie-arnold-location-johnson-city-tennessee","photo-caption":"<p><strong>Name<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/julie911.tumblr.com\/\" title=\"Perfectly Imperfect\">Julie Arnold<\/a><br\/><strong>Location<\/strong> Johnson City, Tennessee<br\/><strong>First post<\/strong> November 2007<\/p>\n\n<p>After growing up in Barcelona, living in Germany for ten years, and finally moving to the USA in 1998, Julie Arnold graduated from EMT school and worked as a medic in an ambulance for six years.

What started as a fun experiment has grown into one of the largest networks on the web, serving billions of views across more than 11 million blogs.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an unparalleled privilege to spend every single day building a product used by so many extraordinarily talented people. We are constantly in awe of your creations and projects, your communities and thoughtfulness. Every person on our team has been moved by this community in one way or another.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, all of this new attention has led to some serious growing pains over the last few months.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s never 100% optimism when we feel like we\u2019ve let you down. We want you to know that we\u2019re still right in the thick of the most comprehensive re-architecting our infrastructure has ever been through, and while you might still hit some bugs or errors this month, our incredibly capable team is working 24\/7 to keep your blogs fast and stable. We have a solid roadmap to get Tumblr well ahead of capacity, and we\u2019re working fast to get there.<\/p>\n<p>Two notable things we\u2019re right in the middle of:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>We\u2019ve dramatically expanded our engineering team,<\/strong> with five brilliant engineers coming on board just this month and more starting shortly. We just moved into a new office to make room for everyone. If scaling one of the fastest growing platforms in the world is up your alley, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/jobs\">we\u2019d love to talk<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>After the holidays, we\u2019ll be opening our second datacenter<\/strong> to nearly triple capacity and prep for much faster growth next year. Today, we already light up more than a rack of new servers every week.<\/p>\n<p>If you do hit issues, you can check for status updates on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/help\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/help\">http:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/help<\/a><\/a> or our <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tumblr\">Twitter feed<\/a>. Please never hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:support@tumblr.com\">contact support<\/a> if you see anything acting weird.<\/p>\n<p>Frustratingly, while we pride ourselves on launching new tools and features faster than anyone, we\u2019ve had to slow down our product roadmap over the last few weeks to let our engineers turn their full attention to scaling. The very good news is that our product team hasn\u2019t slowed down a bit, and is prepping some huge developments to show off soon.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>One last thing:<\/strong> We strive to keep our company and infrastructure super-efficient, but growing this quickly isn\u2019t particularly cheap. Tumblr is largely made possibly today by our extremely supportive investors, <a href=\"http:\/\/sparkcapital.com\/\">Spark Capital<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unionsquareventures.com\/\">Union Square Ventures<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sequoiacap.com\/\">Sequoia Capital<\/a>, who we\u2019re thrilled to have joining us this month.
