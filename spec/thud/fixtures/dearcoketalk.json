Your weight is far less important to me than whether you&#8217;re healthy, well groomed, stylish, and confident.<\/p>\n<p>Still, let&#8217;s not kid ourselves. Morbid obesity, by its very definition, isn&#8217;t healthy. The American version of overweight is usually unattractive because it is the direct result of a shitty diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Of course, the American version of underweight is equally unattractive because it&#8217;s usually the result of an eating disorder or some other physical disease.<\/p>\n<p>Being healthy almost always implies being at an appropriate weight for your body type.
